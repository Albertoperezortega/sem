Group Submission
The coursework must be delivered by a group. The aim of the module is to assess your ability to work as a team to deliver a product. Therefore, the majority of your coursework grade will be based on your team's ability to work together using the methods defined in the module.

The submission is monitored during lab stand-up meetings, and formally via the 5 assessment points. Your submissions are delivered via your GitHub repository. The master branch of your GitHub repository should also be submitted to Moodle at each assessment point along with a spreadsheet in Excel format (csv, xls or xlsx) detailing Individual team members' contributions.
